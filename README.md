# aerial-autonomy-stack

*Aerial autonomy stack* (AAS) is a software stack to:

1. **Develop** end-to-end drone autonomy with ROS2
2. **Simulate** perception and control in SITL, with YOLOv8, LiDAR and PX4 or ArduPilot
3. **Deploy** in real drones with JetPack on NVIDIA Orin

## Part 1: Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AAS is developed using Ubuntu 22.04 with `nvidia-driver-580` on an i9-13 with RTX 3500 and an i7-11 with RTX 3060—an NVIDIA GPU *is* required for ideal performance
> 
> **To setup the requirements: (i) Ubuntu, (ii) NVIDIA driver, (iii) Docker Engine, and (iv) NVIDIA Container Toolkit (with NVIDIA NGC API Key), read [`REQUIREMENTS_UBUNTU.md`](/supplementary/REQUIREMENTS_UBUNTU.md)**
>
> Windows 11 support is available *via* WSLg, read [`REQUIREMENTS_WSL.md`](/supplementary/REQUIREMENTS_WSL.md)

> [!WARNING]
> The 1st build takes ~45GB of space and ~25' with good internet (`Ctrl + c` and restart if needed)


```sh
# Install dependencies (git, Git LFS, Xterm)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs xterm xfonts-base
git lfs install

# Clone this repo
mkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/JacopoPan/aerial-autonomy-stack.git

# Build the Docker images
cd ~/git/aerial-autonomy-stack/scripts
./sim_build.sh # The first build takes ~25', subsequent ones will take seconds to minutes thanks to the Docker cache
```

---

## Part 2: Simulation and Development

```sh
# Start a simulation
cd ~/git/aerial-autonomy-stack/scripts
AUTOPILOT=px4 NUM_QUADS=1 NUM_VTOLS=1 WORLD=swiss_town ./sim_run.sh # Check the script for more options (note: ArduPilot SITL takes ~40s to be ready to arm)
```

> [!NOTE]
> On a low-mid range laptop—i7-11 with 16GB RAM and RTX 3060—AAS simulates three PX4 quads with camera and LiDAR at 99% real-time-factor (note that ArduPilot faster physics updates and more complex worlds have higher computational demands). Make sure you run `sudo prime-select nvidia` and rebooted to effectively leverage GPU compute.

![worlds](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a2f2ad-cc31-4d71-aa2e-4fe542a59a77)

Available `WORLD`s:
- `apple_orchard`, a GIS world created using [BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS)
- `impalpable_greyness`, (default) an empty world with simple shapes
- `shibuya_crossing`, a 3D world adapted from [cgtrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/)
- `swiss_town`, a photogrammetry world courtesy of [Pix4D / pix4d.com](https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000235126)

To advance the simulation in **discrete time steps**, e.g. 1s, from a terminal on the host, run:

```sh
docker exec simulation-container bash -c " \
  gz service -s /world/\$WORLD/control \
    --reqtype gz.msgs.WorldControl --reptype gz.msgs.Boolean \
    --req 'multi_step: 250, pause: true'" # Adjust multi_step based on the value of max_step_size in the world's .sdf (defaults: 250 for PX4, 1000 for ArduPilot)
```

To add or disable [**wind effects**](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/blob/gz-sim10/examples/worlds/wind.sdf), from a terminal on the host, run:

```sh
docker exec simulation-container bash -c " \
  gz topic -t /world/\$WORLD/wind/ -m gz.msgs.Wind \
  -p 'linear_velocity: {x: 0.0 y: 3.0}, enable_wind: true'" # Positive X blows from the West, positive Y blows from the South

docker exec simulation-container bash -c " \
  gz topic -t /world/\$WORLD/wind/ -m gz.msgs.Wind \
  -p 'enable_wind: false'" # Disable WindEffects
```

### Fly a Mission

```sh
cd ~/git/aerial-autonomy-stack/scripts
AUTOPILOT=px4 NUM_QUADS=1 ./sim_run.sh # Or `ardupilot`, or `NUM_VTOLS=1`

# In aircraft 1's terminal
ros2 run mission mission --conops yalla \
  --ros-args -r __ns:=/Drone$DRONE_ID -p use_sim_time:=true # This mission is a simple takeoff, followed by an orbit, and landing for any vehicle

# Finally, in the simulation's terminal
/simulation_resources/patches/plot_logs.sh # Analyze the flight logs
```

To create a new mission, read the banner comments in [`ardupilot_interface.hpp`](/aircraft/aircraft_ws/src/autopilot_interface/src/ardupilot_interface.hpp) and [`px4_interface.hpp`](/aircraft/aircraft_ws/src/autopilot_interface/src/px4_interface.hpp) for command line examples of takeoff, orbit, reposition, offboard, land

Once flown from CLI, implemented your mission in [`MissionNode.conops_callback()`](/aircraft/aircraft_ws/src/mission/mission/mission_node.py)

![interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b07851-42dd-45d4-a9f5-6b5b00cd85bc)

### Development within Live Containers

Launching the `sim_run.sh` script with `MODE=dev`, does **not** start the simulation and mounts folders `simulation_resources`, `aircraft_resources`, and `ros2_ws/src` as volumes to more easily track, commit, push changes while building and testing them within the containers

```sh
cd ~/git/aerial-autonomy-stack/scripts
MODE=dev ./sim_run.sh # Starts one simulation-image and one aircraft-image where the ros2_ws/src/ and *_resources/ folders are mounted from the host
```

To build changes made **on the host** in either `simulation_ws/src` or `aircraft_ws/src`

```sh
cd ros2_ws/ # In the simulation and/or in the aircraft container
colcon build --symlink-install
```

To start the simulation (by default, this is a single PX4 quad, configure using `sim_run.sh`)

```sh
tmuxinator start -p /simulation.yml.erb # In the simulation container
tmuxinator start -p /aircraft.yml.erb # In the aircraft container
```

Once done, detach Tmux with `Ctrl + b`, then `d`; kill everything with `tmux kill-server && pkill -f gz`

## Part 3: Jetson Deployment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions are tested on a [Holybro Jetson Baseboard](https://holybro.com/products/pixhawk-jetson-baseboard) (Pixhawk 6X + NVIDIA Orin NX 16GB)
> 
> **To setup (i.a) PX4's DDS UDP client or (i.b) ArduPilot serial MAVLink bridge, (ii) JetPack 6, (iii) Docker Engine, and (iv) NVIDIA Container Toolkit (with NVIDIA NGC API Key) on Orin, read [`SETUP_AVIONICS.md`](/supplementary/SETUP_AVIONICS.md)**

```sh
# Install dependencies (git, Git LFS)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs
git lfs install

# Clone this repo
mkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/JacopoPan/aerial-autonomy-stack.git

# On Jetson Orin NX, build for arm64 with TensorRT support
cd ~/git/aerial-autonomy-stack/scripts
./deploy_build.sh # The first build takes ~1h (mostly to build onnxruntime-gpu from source)
```

> Latest weekly build with `deploy_build.sh`:

```sh
# On Jetson Orin NX, start and attach an aircraft-container (e.g., from ssh)
DRONE_TYPE=quad AUTOPILOT=px4 DRONE_ID=1 CAMERA=true LIDAR=false ./deploy_run.sh
docker exec -it aircraft-container tmux attach
```

> You've done a man's job, sir. I guess you're through, huh?

<!-- 

### Known Issues

- wmctrl does not work as-is in WSLg
- QGC is started with a virtual joystick (with low throttle if using only VTOLs and centered throttle if there are quads), this is reflective of real-life but note that this counts as "RC loss" when switching focus from one autopilot instance to another
- ArduPilot CIRCLE mode for quads require to explicitly center the virtual throttle with 'rc 3 1500' to keep altitude
- Gazebo WindEffects plugin is disabled/not working for PX4 standard_vtol
- Command 178 MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED is accepted but not effective in changing speed for ArduPilot VTOL
- ArduPilot SITL for Iris uses option -f that also sets "external": True, this is not the case for the Alti Transition from ArduPilot/SITL_Models 
- In ArdupilotInterface's action callbacks, std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(node_data_mutex_); could be used on the reads of lat_, lon_, alt_
- In yolo_inference_node.py, cannot open GPU accelerated (nvh264dec) GStreamer pipeline with cv2.VideoCapture, might need to recompile OpenCV to have both CUDA and GStreamer support (or use python3-gi gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 and circumvent OpenCV)
- QGC does not save roll and pitch in the telemetry bar for PX4 VTOLs (MAV_TYPE 22)
- PX4 quad max tilt is limited by the anti-windup gain (zero it to deactivate it): const float arw_gain = 2.f / _gain_vel_p(0);

- Profit

Add back to AVIONICS.md
- The Holybro Jetson Baseboard comes with an (i) integrated 4-way (Orin, 6X, RJ-45, JST) Ethernet switch and (ii) two JST USB 2.0 that can be connected to ASIX Ethernet adapters to create additional network interfaces
- Make sure to configure Orin, 6X's XRCE-DDS, IP radio, Zenoh, etc. consistently with your network setup; the camera acquisition pipeline should be setup in `yolo_inference_node.py`, the LiDAR should publish on topic `/lidar_points` for KISS-ICP (if necessary, discuss in the [Issues](https://github.com/JacopoPan/aerial-autonomy-stack/issues))

# Desired features

- Support for [JSBSim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim) flight dynamics
- Support for [ArduPilot's DDS interface](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/ros2-interfaces.html)

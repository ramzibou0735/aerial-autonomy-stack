## The 2 Facets of the Sim2real Gap

The *sim2real gap* is an euphemism for robotic projects that work well on a developer's laptop but not so much in the field.
Aerial sim2real research often focuses on modeling and simulation of complex aerodynamics effects.

Nonetheless, in applied robotics, an equally important component of *sim2real gap* lies in software tooling and engineering, where the dynamic range between ["average and the best is 50-to-1, maybe 100-to-1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTgQ2PBiz-g&t=35s).

This is the challenge—and good sport—of **full-stack integration** among:

- the **many frameworks** that go into drone autonomy (a physics engine to simulate drone dynamics, a rendering engine to generate realistic imagery, a GPU-accelerated machine learning runtime for perception, one or more inter-process and inter-thread communication middleware, the interface to the microcontroller and autopilot software performing state-estimation and low-level control, the SDKs of the deployed embedded systems, etc.)
- emulated **inter-robot communication** (in aerial systems, this is heavily affected by the actual flight plans and available RF hardware)

## Design Manifesto

- **Simplicity** (["simple is better than complex"](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), ["worse is better"](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html), and ["no fat software"](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Articles/LeanSoftware.pdf) are the 3 slogans of the AAS)
- [おまかせ](https://dhh.dk/2012/rails-is-omakase.html) **end-to-end**ness (from camera frames, to autopilot uORB/MAVLink commands)
- **Recentness** (break and fix, rather than carrying technical [debt](https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html))
- **Deployment** focus
    - Clear, Dockerized split between simulation and aircraft software
    - ROS2 intra-companion board messaging
    - XRCE-DDS (PX4), MAVROS (ArduPilot) autopilot-to-companion board ROS2 UDP bridge
    - GStreamer camera-to-companion board acquisition
    - Zenoh inter-vehicle ROS2 bridge, with networking emulated by `docker network`
